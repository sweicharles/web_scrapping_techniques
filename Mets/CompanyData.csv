This enables budget costs, construction review and scheduling information to be created and evaluated before problems arise once the design has left the office.Providing guidance tools to ensure designs are constructed as intendedProviding a management tool that enables review and monitoring of current operational production statistics. By reporting statistics on production rates, areas of good & bad production, areas & volume of re handle, and task ratios (pushing: ripping), operations the management will have a better grasp on how to fix poor efficiency areas inside the operation. In effect we help management make strategic decisions rather than reactive ones. If you can measure it you can manage it.3D Data Guidance works closely with customers to design and implement solutions to suit their specific earthwork needs, including data control, preparation, equipment selection and efficient earthwork strategies.Using smart design concepts in creating a Bulldozer Blade that increases the efficiency of the machine, while saving fuel and increasing production.The services we provide can allow Mining Companies, Earthmoving Contractors and Reclamation Consultants to achieve better rehabilitation outcomes at lower costs.",https://www.3ddataguidance.com/,"3D Data Guidance Pty Ltd

Amazon Web Services,"The Mining and METS sector around the world relies on Amazon Web Services global leadership in cloud computing to build innovative solutions, migrate critical applications, and improve their financial position by retiring costly legacy technology. This shift to the cloud, helps companies deliver operational insight, condition-based maintenance, data integration as well as improved customer experience initiatives such as field mobility, digital twins and natural language interfaces.","The mining industry represents a large and growing segment of AWS customers. Examples include Operators such as Rio Tinto, Oz Minerals, and Barrick Gold, and METS leaders such as Siemens, Esri, OSIsoft, Trimble and Schneider Electric.Operators are looking to predictive analytics to generate insight across operations and find further productivity gains that allow them to either mine more material, or to reduce the assets they need to maintain current mining levels.We are focusing on the 5 key initiatives for the mining vertical:1. Helping mining companies build integrated data platforms to provide a single view of operations, fusion between disparate datasets, data discovery and provide tools for analytics2. Helping mining companies derive insight upstream in the value chain - a deeper understanding of the ore-body, intelligent drilling, fragmentation analysis and modelling stockpile value3. A scalable platform for system-wide optimization and scenario planning, allowing Operators to perform discrete event simulation, Monte Carlo analysis and ‘what-if’ planning associated with major projects, operating model changes or daily operations4. Accelerating connected and autonomous mining for Operators and reducing OEM dependence through the use of a common platform (from the edge to the cloud), modern AI engines and open data on advanced GPU instances, elastic infrastructure, and Amazon SageMaker for machine learning lifecycle management5. Accelerate digital transformations by running SAP environments on AWS. AWS can help Operators move faster, operate more securely, and save substantial costs; all while benefiting from the scale and performance of SAP in the cloud.Key benefits of AWS for mining use-cases are: a) Innovation: Harness the power of elastic cloud computing, big data, analytics, and machine learning to extract insights from data and bring unusual value to the enterprise, more timely decisions or plant optimizations, b) Speed and Agility: rapidly design, provision, and deploy new capability into highly functional and beneficial enterprise domains, and c) Economics: pay-as-you go, elastic and serverless computing models reduce the cost of running infrastructure and require minimum upfront investments.",https://aws.amazon.com/,,MiningOil & GasAsset ManagementAutomationControl SystemsExploration Equipment & ServicesInformation Technology HardwareManagement ConsultingMarket Intelligence ServicesProfessional ServicesResearch & DevelopmentSensors & MonitoringSoftware SolutionsTraining & SimulationWorkforce Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an optional extra to our standard scraper.The TS30 cleaner allows for extremely fast removal and replacement of blades thus reducing down time of equipment.The TS20 cleaner sits at right angles to the belt and from its geometry has little or no edges for material being scraped to build-up on, making it a very efficient unit; it can also operate on reversing belts.Our scrapers can be supplied on disc or emailed to you in .dwg format.‘V’ PloughsOur standard plough has UHMW Polyethylene blades that can be changed in situ without the use of tools. Down time is minimised and removal is easy.We believe our products are very well priced and have proven themselves in many areas; now with the quick changeover time for the TS30 blades and being independently loaded we believe there is a great potential for sales of this scraper in Australia and overseas.",http://www.taurus-scrapers.com/,,VIC - MelbourneUndergroundOpen CutBulk Materials HandlingConveyor Equipment & Components,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For existing plants, our ability to model and optimise plant performance leads to immediate and direct results both operationally and on the bottom line.Asset Strategy Management - A holistic, consistent and standardised approach to managing your asset strategies, organisation-wide. Physical assets and independent sites are connected to a central system, allowing you to effectively develop, implement, maintain and optimise asset strategies. Implementing an ASM program ensures that optimal strategies are always deployed, quickly and efficiently, resulting in the reduction of failures, downtime and risk, and as a consequence, a lower cost of operations.Maintenance Strategy Development and Optimisation - Maintenance strategies developed using the principles of RCM on critical assets ensures that the right maintenance is specified at the optimum interval. Application of generic maintenance plans from library models ensures that plans are developed efficiently in an appropriate time frame.Life Cycle Costing - Analysing the cost of an asset over its lifetime can be an important element for assessing different potential solutions before the project begins, including developing a maintenance budget. It is also useful in analysing whether to repair or replace an asset. We can provide expert support for estimating your life cycle costs and can assist with business case preparation for large capital expenditure proposals.RAMS Studies - Not sure where to begin with reliability improvement or cost reduction?

Our purpose-built software platform automates knowledge work and builds sustainable competitive advantage by delivering high returns over the entire asset lifecycle. As a result, companies in capital-intensive industries can maximize uptime and push the limits of performance, running their assets faster, safer, longer and greener.By using real machine learning with normal, abnormal, and failure signature agents, damage can be prevented. Looming issues can be seen weeks or even months earlier to allow for more time for investigation and planning with Aspen Mtell®. Not only that, Mtell can see things other solutions cannot to prevent process-induced damage. More importantly, Mtell attaches a failure to a specific root cause which guides operations and maintenance leaders directly to the fix. With the numerous moving parts within the continuous casting process, challenging and expensive equipment failures have occurred. The turret, oscillating mold, cooling chamber, induction stirrer, and numerous rollers must be working within specified parameters or serious problems could arise and severely impact earnings and possibly the safety of employees. Future occurrences can be avoided with early detection and detailed prescriptive analytics provided by machine learning.Aspen Fidelis Reliability™ is a reliability, availability and maintainability tool built on a digital twin of the process at mines, mills and refineries. This solution is uniquely designed to model all equipment assets and process flows to effectively determine asset utilization, overall equipment effectiveness and other parameters that define operating conditions, reliability and costs of assets.Aspen ProMV™ delivers multivariate analysis tailored to the unique needs of continuous and batch processing that is found in mines with flotation and recovery as well as metal refineries. As ore changes with each block or polygon extracted, flotation and recovery can be adapted based on the chemical composition of the slurry. Recovery can be enhanced by specific changes in stirrer tip speed, supply feed flow-rate, tailings flow-rate, and air supply that reduce process variability.",https://www.aspentech.com/,"Aspen Technology Australia Pty Ltd.

Advantages include:• Safety – no explosion risk during fitting or when in use.• Reliability – sharp rocks, bolts and other obstacles that would destroy a pneumatic tyre through side wall or tread damage are not a problem for a solid wheel.• Increased load capacity – pneumatic tyres typically can’t carry the kind of loads required within the space restrictions of underground mining. Using pneumatic tyres in an overload situation will lead to premature failure potentially evidenced as sidewall splitting and or tread separation.• Customised ground clearance – whether you need minimal ground clearance to bring your equipment down a low clearance entrance to the mine or even elevated clearance due to the terrain within the mine, solid wheels can be built to suit the application.• Low ground pressure – although you might not imagine it, solid wheels can actually be designed to give a lower ground pressure than a pneumatic for a given size and load capacity requirement.• Other customisable options – this includes the tread pattern based on your site requirements, high quality European chain fitment, chain guard to prevent wheel chains from slipping onto and damaging the brake line, stainless components to prevent the wheel from seizing onto the machine in corrosive environments.• Cost efficiency – due to their increased reliability (removing expensive downtime) and longer life (more rubber to wear down), solid wheels are the most cost-effective solution for many operations.Big Tyre’s wheels are built from the highest quality rubber we can source, and different rubber compounds are available depending on the application. Combining high quality materials and our world class techniques and processes enables Big Tyre to build wheels that are second to none. This quality is backed up with our 2-year warranty that even has extension options available. Our solid wheels are shipped to over 50 countries around the world and we are the preferred supplier to several leading original equipment manufacturers.",http://www.bigtyre.com.au/,,UndergroundLongwallOpen CutCoal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lubrication Management, On-site Oil Sampling, Oil Cleaning & Filtration Equipment for Hire or Sale, Contract Oil Cleaning, Centrifuges, breathers and other lube equipment","Clean Oil Services Pty Ltd commenced business in 1996 as an independent Oil Analysis Laboratory. Our laboratory services clients in many industries including mining, heavy industry, Oil &Gas, transport and power.Many oil samples we test are taken from very large oil compartments, holding hundreds or thousands of litres of oil. We often recommended the common practice that oil be changed out and disposed of, because it was contaminated with wear metals, dust or water.The huge cost of this waste, as well as the negative environmental impact made us look for alternate solutions and over time we designed a machine capable of removing contamination easily, economically and quickly, to extend oil life without having to shut productive machinery down.Our first LUBEMASTER was patented in 2003 and we have continued to innovate and design for various applications.Equipment and the maintenance and lubrication of equipment, is a major cost to industry. Our vision is to keep the oil in perfect condition while it is in service and remove the need of changing oil for a significantly extended period, or even at all. In today’s economic environment, there is no room for unnecessary costs and inefficient management of resources.The cost of manufacturing in Australia is becoming prohibitive and many other industries including mining and power are looking to reduce their production costs. Just doubling the oil hours results in an immediate cost savings of 50% on new oil purchases.Lubemaster oil cleaning units are unlike any other units currently available. The Lubemaster is based on centrifuge over a vacuum system, and cleans oil to cleaner than new oil specs without issues with blocked elements due to particles larger than the element pore size.Our Lubemaster range includes:• Lubemaster standard c/w 300L tank, air vacuum, 70 lpm centrifuge, fully mobile.• Lubemaster Transformer model incorporates F/E filtration to remove acid from oil• Lubemaster mill unit – suits crushing mills on mining sites• Lubemaster Upright – easy to manoeuvre in small spaces• Lubemaster EXD – certified for use in volatile environments• Wastemaster –cleans large volumes of waste oil for re-use.

Ecosoft Water,"Ecosoft Water provides Australian designed and manufactured water treatment systems for the prevention and in situ removal of lime scale caused by hard water.
Ecosoft Water Conditioners are chemical free, maintenance free, have no moving parts and do not require a power supply.","Mines are often located in extremely remote regions with little or no access to fresh surface water. As a result, mining operations are often limited to using ground water for everything from potable water for accommodation camps, through to flushing and down hole water systems used in drilling applications. Ground water typically has a very high mineral count. Calcium and other salts often precipitate out of the water causing fouling which leads to reduced pressure and flow and subsequent increased maintenance and/or equipment failure.This highly mineralised water causes ongoing problems for asset owners across the mines processes and infrastructure. Traditionally lime scale build up is removed by either chemical or mechanical means. Ecosoft Water Conditioners provide the chemical and maintenance free solution to problems associated with hard water.Typical applications where Ecosoft Water Conditioners can reduce system maintenance and increase equipment life cycle include: Blast Hole Drill Rigs, Jumbos, Cooling Towers, Heat Exchangers, Evaporative Coolers, Hot Water Systems, Accommodation, De-Watering, Commercial Kitchens, Ice Rooms etc",http://www.ecosoftwater.com.au/,"Ecosoft Water

Founded in 2018, Emesent has since built a reputation for delivering high-quality data capture in the mining, infrastructure, survey and mapping industries.Their flagship product, Hovermap, is a smart mobile scanning unit that combines advanced collision avoidance and autonomous flight technologies to map hazardous and GPS-denied environments.Its award-winning technology utilizes innovative hardware, advanced algorithms and machine learning to automate collection and analysis of the physical world. Equally capable above ground or underground, indoors or out, Hovermap is a complete mobile LiDAR mapping solution. Hovermap is uniquely versatile, it can be handheld, drone- or vehicle-mounted to map challenging, inaccessible areas enabling our customers to gain insights that were not possible before.With multiple applications across several industries and a rapidly growing customer base, Hovermap and our other solutions are being used commercially for a variety of applications by enterprise customers around the world.In mining, safety and productivity are the driving forces behind continuous improvement and innovation. Leading mining companies strive to enhance profitability by increasing productivity while still focussing on safety to reduce risk. In mining, especially underground, this is even more challenging. Presently, the only way to obtain 3D information and data on underground voids and assets is to send people and equipment into areas of very limited access and that pose a large risk on human lives.Emesent’s Hovermap solves the issue of obtaining data from inaccessible surroundings. Hovermap is rapidly changing how we mine, providing access to valuable data well beyond the traditional safe operation areas, gaining insights in places never possible before while providing digital twins of entire mines in a matter of hours. Speed and accuracy are crucial; being able to collect quality data to make informed decisions is vital in Mining.",http://www.emesent.io/,"Emesent

Fracht has been an active provider of international logistics services in Australia since 1984.","The continent of Australia has always been an important part of the world for the FRACHT Group to do business in. The rugged and sometimes desolate topography of this great land is amongst the same as the environment FRACHT LTD has excelled in throughout many project transports in the Middle East and developing countries. Northern Australia replicates the intricate and challenging environs of South East Asia and the areas of Central and South America. Another proving ground for FRACHT to clients such as the Siemens Group. Alstom, Hitachi or ABB.In 1987 FRACHT LTD invested in Australia and together with FRACHT Australia's Managing Director, Peter Pluess, began representing the FRACHT Group's interests. Peter had worked for FRACHT AG globally since 1976 and had already been here in Australia representing the FRACHT Group since early 1983.This company was established in late 1987 with the head office in Sydney and a branch office in Melbourne.The second local shareholder and Director of Fracht Australia Pty Limited, Peter Gasnier also had a long association with the Fracht Group. He joined a Fracht related company in early 1986.Fracht opened its fully operational Adelaide branch office in 1991 and further expansion saw the establishment of Fracht in Brisbane and Perth in 1995.Today Fracht Australia is owned 50% by Fracht AG Basel / Switzerland and 50% by Peter Pluess and Peter Gasnier. In Australia the group operates from 3 locations in Sydney and offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. All offices have project transport capabilities and enjoy a solid reputation for superb Customer Care and Swiss quality service.Our Swiss shareholder FRACHT LTD is one of Switzerland's leading and most respected international logistics providers with offices and joint ventures in most important trade centres all over the world. FRACHT LTD is also one of the most successful project forwarders specialising in heavy lifts and other types of very challenging movements.The combination of a powerful, well established forwarder overseas owning 50 per cent of our shares while the Australian directors own the other 50 per cent results in many tangible benefits for our clients. On the one hand there is the very solid background, support and strength from overseas and on the other hand a very fast, efficient and hands on decision making process without interference from overseas.",http://www.fracht.com.au/,,Transportation Services & Storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frontier Automation,Frontier Automation is a technology and engineering company focused on the development and implementation of performance improving automation software based on 3-dimensional sensing instrumentation and industrial computer hardware. We specialize in the implementation of industrial and mining application solutions using real time high precision and high resolution machine vision technologies. Our technologies are capable of fully autonomous operation.,"Several mature products in mining, industrial, and commercial shipping applications already deployed and operational on large customer sites are available as ready-made offerings. The company is also capable to develop and has a successful track record in delivering complex customized solutions to new customer automation needs. We have fully fledged internally developed simulation environments / digital twins available for custom developments.Our ultra-low maintenance sensor instrumentation is custom designed for deployment in harsh environments and provides high resolution three dimensional data independent of lighting conditions that eliminates the risk of detection errors typical for competing systems.Product Selection:3DReclaimOur flagship product 3DReclaim is tailor made for reclaimers in use in stockyards of iron ore, coal, and other mining or bulk material handling facilities. It uses our patented machine vision control system and has been proven in a range of customer installations to dramatically improve reclaimer performance in comparison to conventional PLC based methods. 3DReclaim actively scans stockpile volume ahead of the bucket wheel in real time to directly control the reclaim process with the world’s first truly volume based controller. The system optimizes face up and end of bench sequences and controls the slew turnaround to minimize unproductive air digging. It also prevents downtime through bogging events typical for conventional control operations.3DPortGuard3DPortGuard is our company’s solution for port operators looking to stay in control of a ship’s movements while approaching, departing, or mooring at a berth. As for all Frontier Automation control systems, it uses machine vision to automatically detect and track in real time shipping vessels within range of a berth by providing information on critical distances to mooring infrastructure, on vessel speed, and on vessel movement directions and orientations. This data is used by pilot or port operators to maintain control of a safe mooring or departure procedure or to establish root causes during incident investigations.Our dedicated drift detection algorithm allows bulk material or any other loading terminals to ensure safe operation and to avoid very costly damages to loading or port infrastructure or through spills by facilitating automated alarms and shutdowns in case a vessel exceeds safe loading movement parameters or breaks its moorings.",http://www.frontierautomation.com.au/,"Frontier Automation

Our experienced team is committed to assisting mining companies with solutions to prevent or resolve fuel contamination issues, prevent equipment downtime/damage, improve site fuel efficiency and reduce adverse environmental impacts.Fuel Technology are the sole distributors throughout Australia and New Zealand for the innovative DieselPure bulk storage filtration systems. With common rail systems operating at such high pressures and fine tolerances, filtration of the highest standard is no longer an option but a necessity. Regardless of fuel storage tank turnover, fine particulates and moisture in the diesel can build up, leading to gradual fuel system corrosion, premature equipment engine wear or severe problems with critical engine components.DieselPure are driving fuel cleanliness to new levels by being able to remove what most filters can’t. Tested to industry standard SAE J1488_2010, they have been proven to remove contaminants down to sub-micron level and free water, while achieving a 100% efficiency rating in removing emulsified water.We also provide a mobile diesel tank cleaning service. Our truck-mounted system removes fine particulates, free water and emulsified water. Tanks will be free of microbial growth on the walls and bottom, protecting fuel system components while preventing contamination and corrosion. While most aspects of any operation have a maintenance plan, diesel storage tanks are often neglected.

GOLD GEAR INTERNATIONAL,"GOLD GEAR INTERNATIONAL - specialises in appropriate technology for mercury eradication in ASM/SSGM and mercury reclamation through specially developed and dedicated technology.
This AT has been developed over 30 years alluvial mining and small-scale hard-rock mining exposure in far NQ and throughout PNG for over 20 years and Indonesia and Papua for 3 years. Recently teamed up with two mercury experts in govt and UNEP and we are looking for a partner to launch into the World. - PARTNER SOUGHT.","Mercury Eradication and Reclamation are becoming very big issues around the globe and are being pushed and funded by the GEF for Billions of dollars in the clean-up and supply of better more appropriate technology.We seek funding from METS Ignited and have been advised to 'seek out' an established international mining company or group to form a partnership with, for the realization of funding our technologies release.There are a well documented 70 countries with over 25 million miners dependant on small scale mining AT and the GEF, UNEP, UNDP & UNIDO thanks to the likes of AGC are placing inappropriate, expensive & non - portable pieces of kit into the field in Burkina Faso, Peru and soon likely to be in Colombia, Indonesia, Guyana, Kenya, Philippines and Mongolia with this unpractical tech to the tune of over $49 million dollars.GEF Program Objective: Reduce the use of mercury in the ASGM sector in the participating countries by facilitating the access to finance to artisanal miners and mining communities for the introduction of low and non-mercury technologies and techniques and through the development of sustainable ASGM gold supply chains.We have the Best Tech to achieve the best results and want a reasonable chance to get it out there and into the game.OUR CURRENT AIM: To find a progressive and resourceful partner to assist with manufacturing, further development, completing the joint study with QU SMI-JKMRC for the data collation and assessment of this revolutionary technology.We can also be of real assistance in the international mining groups likely struggle at times with LA's and the Large - scale/Small - scale relationships that invariably occur with most mining sites and the ability to appease/defuse and remedy associated LA problems that can see better co-existence and even conformity by the local ASM / SSGM community.Most situations involve boundary, tailings, safety, access and generally other issues around fairness, which does drive a lot of the decent with the all important environmental issues and when we have the tech that eradicates the dependency on the use of mercury and where our MRS tech actually reclaims elemental mercury and over 20 other metals and toxins from sediment, then we can do much for the Environment.",,,MiningPrecious metals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed beneficiation and hydrometallurgy processing plant will treat rare earths deposits, predominantly monazite, hosting high neodymium and praseodymium contents to produce a mixed rare earths carbonate that will be further refined into individual rare earth oxides at processing plants overseas.Neodymium and praseodymium are vital components in the manufacture of permanent magnets which is used in a wide and expanding range of advanced and high-tech products including electric vehicles, wind turbines, robotics, medical applications and others. Hastings aims to become the next significant producer of neodymium and praseodymium outside of China.Hastings holds 100% interest in the most significant deposits within the overall project, and 70% interest in additional deposits that will be developed at a later date, all held under Mining Leases. Numerous prospects have been identified warranting detailed exploration to further extend the life of the project.Brockman ProjectThe Brockman deposit, near Halls Creek in Western Australia, contains JORC Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, estimated using the guidelines of JORC Code (2012 Edition).The Company is also progressing a Mining Lease application over the Brockman Rare Earths and Rare Metals Project.Hastings aims to capitalise on the strong demand for critical rare earths created by the expanding demand for new technology products.For further information on the Company and its projects visit www.hastingstechmetals.com",http://www.hastingstechmetals.com/,,WA - PerthOpen CutRare earths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hawcroft Consulting International Group,"Apply a systematic and objective approach to the identification of significant risks within mining , processing and associated industries and related processes to ensure that appropriate controls are in place.
To be the preferred supplier for risk engineering services to global insurance markets and mining, processing, mine construction and allied industries.
Our risk engineering process systematically defines and evaluates significant risks within the mining industry.","The independence of the Hawcroft report is well regarded within the international insurance industry and provides an independent view of insurance and business risks.1). While we both quantify and qualify risks and controls we also provide a balanced view indicating where there is a good level of risk control.2) Hawcroft Engineers all have significant high level managerial experience enabling them to look at both the Approach (strategic) and Deployment (tactical application) of risk controls. Recommendations made are appropriate to the level of risk and when completed in many instances will have a direct and materially positive bearing on the risk profile of the mine.3) As a result of our experience with the major mining insurance markets and the industry globally Hawcroft have an understanding of the market expectations and the best practices around the control of high risk operations and facilities within mining operations and infrastructure.4) Our Engineers actively engage with the mining and engineering teams on site and our survey process provides opportunity at all stages for the mine to interact.5) Hawcroft rate each individual risk area providing a level of granularity that enables the mine operations to build their internal risk engineering approach to target high priorities maximising return.6) We specialise in mining and processing operations and associated infrastructure so we know what to look for and what to expect.7) As mining specialists we can provide expertise on improving business resilience through business continuity planning. This can identify measures that significantly reduce or mitigate the business interruption potential from a loss event.8). The larger reinsurers are deemed to be ‘Technical Underwriters’ and employ Mining Engineers as Underwriters or technical review engineers. These Underwriters appreciate the quality and content of a Hawcroft survey report and often accompany our engineers on site visits.To this end, Hawcroft reports may result in a higher participation in the insurance program from the major insurers and re-insurers. This can both improve coverage offered, reduced deductibles and exclusions and potentially drive competitive rates from insurers.",http://hawcroft.com.au/,"Hawcroft Consulting International Group

InnovEco Australia has developed and patented two methods of metal extraction based on the continuous ion exchange (CIX) technology.","InnovEco Australia has developed and patented two methods of metal extraction based on the continuous ion exchange (CIX) technology.First method based on resin in pulp (RIP) process and designed for metal recovery from low grade ores, tailings, slag and wastes with high content of fine fractions.Second method, named resin in moisturized mix (RIMM), represents new approach to ion exchange resin handling. The RIMM process combines leaching and sorption processes and provides significant improvements to the CIX process itself.Both methods demonstrate higher recovery rates, lower consumption of water and chemicals and much lower environmental impact in comparison with traditional extraction technologies.Major Applications• metal extraction from low grade ores and ores with high content of fines• reprocessing of tailings, slags and other metallurgical and industrial waste• effective extraction of by-products• recovering metals from old leaching pads, mine and process water• improving technical and economic parameters of the existing smelters, refineries and hydrometallurgical plants by increasing metal extraction rate (by 10-20%), extracting by-products and removing impurities• removing toxic and dangerous components from soil and industrial waste waterMetals of Interest• copper(Cu), molybdenum(Mo), nickel(Ni), cobalt(Co), vanadium(V), tungsten(W)• rare elements – i.e. germanium (Ge), niobium (Nd), tantalum (Ta)• rare earth elements – i.e. scandium (Sc), cerium (Ce), yttrium (Y)• precious metals – gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum group of elements",http://ion-exchange.com.au/,,MiningBase metalsMineral Separation Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MineRP,"MineRP the system is a spatially dimensioned ERP equivalent framework that integrates and aligns Mining Technical Systems (MTS) and ERP domains, while delivers unrivaled capabilities to manage mineral assets, do rapid unified business planning, and orchestrate operational execution.
MineRP believes mines can be run like real-time factories. The systems and data we need is out there - it is merely a matter of orchestrating it.","The Mining Technical Systems Industry has traditionally focused on developing standalone, discrete applications that each serve a specific business need and are complex and expensive to integrate. In stark contrast, MineRP’s approach is that of an ERP system, but one where the client has the option to retain their external original planning and geoscientific systems as ‘modules’ to the Spatial ERP. MineRP integrates with and amalgamates data from current MTS systems in use on mines, unifying all mining technical data within the MineRP Spatial Database. Integration is bi-directional - meaning spatial data can be published from the MineRP Enterprise Framework back to the source systems for discipline-specific work to be done.MineRP has invested heavily in R&D to transform mine planning from traditional silo-based planning to modern, Parametric (Parameter Driven) Unified Business Planning. MineRP Planner is a framework based mine planning solution and promises several paradigm-shifting capabilities, including native integration between Mine Planning and Business Planning (ERP financial enumeration of mine plans).This dramatic new development natively integrates the technical and financial domains for bi-directional planning and optimization. The approach delivers true optimization from the order book through Geology – ie order book to pit to port including all material flow and logistics, in a rapid response to varying economic, price, environmental, and other external conditions or operational events that may arise unexpectedly.MineRP is working with partners such as IBM, SAP and equipment manufacturers like Sandvik to introduce the concept of a single, integrated planning environment utilizing a central CAT (Capabilities, Activities and Time) database. With MineRP CAT, resource allocation and availability can be understood instantaneously in a single domain.",http://www.minerp.com/,"MineRP

MinEx CRC,"MinEx CRC is the world's largest mineral exploration collaboration bringing together Industry, Government and Research Organisations, backed by:
$50M cash from the CRC Programme
$41M cash from geological surveys and from industry
$49M non-staff in-kind
$78M or 311FTE staff in-kind
TOTAL $218M","Mineral and energy resources contributed ~50% of Australia’s exports and ~7% of GDP in 2017-2018. The future of this contribution is at risk due to the trend of the declining discovery of significant, new mineral deposits. The Council of Australian Governments has captured the challenge to Australian mining: “new greenfield discoveries are urgently required to ensure that an ongoing pipeline of mineral resource projects are available to meet future demands. Australia’s attractiveness as an exploration destination has been diminished by a range of factors including;perceptions of Australia as a mature exploration destination where there are fewer opportunities for new discoveries;challenges in exploring for deposits buried under the overlying sand, soil and sediment that covers much of Australia.”There are few, if any, remaining major, new mineral deposits that are exposed at the Earth’s surface remaining to be found in Australia. The technical challenge of cost-effectively finding major, new mineral deposits hidden beneath barren cover rocks has not yet been met. Consequently, mineral exploration is moving from Australia to less well-explored countries with Australia’s share of global mineral exploration reducing from ~1/4 in the 1990s to ~1/8th currently.In order to reverse this trend, we require a new set of exploration tools and new ways to deploy those tools which recognise the fundamental importance of collecting quantity and quality data from the subsurface. Collecting these data requires drilling.MinEx CRC’s research includes:Developing more productive, safer and environmentally-friendly drilling methods to discover and drill-out deposits, including coiled tubing drilling technology.Developing new technologies for collecting data while drilling, bringing forward mine production.Implementation of a National Drilling Initiative (NDI) - a world-first collaboration of Geological Surveys, researchers and industry that will undertake drilling in under-explored areas of potential mineral wealth in Australia.",http://www.minexcrc.com.au/,"MinEx CRC

New H2O Resources Pty Ltd,"The mining industry has ongoing engagement and compliance pressures to earn the right to operate and also ongoing revenue pressures to deliver returns on resources for the shareholders and customers.
New H2O Resources shows mining companies how to take their waste water costs and turn it into a revenue. The use will assist communities, the rural sector and create more job opportunities post mining life.","The mining industry as an essential industry for the Australian and many other resource rich economies. For the industry to still be sustainable, we see that it is essential for the industry to reconsider and re-evaluate how they use all their water resources.New H2O have developed mobile water treatment plants that can be scaled in number and easily located to suit the mine’s needs and size. The filtration plants have a range of water qualities that they can treat to provide an Environment Authority approved discharge quality capability or be used to row feed or crops on suitable irrigated fields adjacent to the mines.New H2O’s technology range offers not only a cost reduction to mines, but is also a revenue stream for mines to provide water for other industries and with the local rural community. The mobile plants rather than the larger fixed infrastructure we see at the moment, allow flexibility and also enable the plant to move with the needs of the mining operations waste water storage facilities. Other technology focuses on measuring the evaporation losses on this valuable resource and provide solutions to minimising evaporation losses that could be as high as 10-14% of total water stored.Over the last 20 years, increased knowledge and concern around the climate change has generated a rise in activism for eco warriors. However, there is a solution for the mining industry and government to reduce their financial exposure and still provide a better business and community solution to a more efficient use of water.Neglecting this issue will hurt government, businesses and communities as water becomes an increasingly valuable commodity. This has occurred in a several areas around the world. Note what happened in Capetown South Africa in 2018 when it almost ran out of water.Environmental assurance bonds are costly, and New H2O Resources see water as a tradeable commodity that will drive new business and value opportunity for water use, agriculture and other ventures around old mining areas.New H2O can provide a range of opportunities for the mining, agriculture and rural sectors. We have access to the latest technology that has ongoing development and high research commitment from international and local experts. We have people that know how each of these industries and how government work.",,"New H2O Resources

Our established and proven track record includes industry-leading strategy and design work across multiple sectors including mining, processing, service providers, mega projects, technology and innovation.","Global leaders in integrated operationsIn an increasingly complex and competitive world, the secret to improved productivity and profitability is INTEGRATION. NextGenOpX is a global leader in integrated operations and has worked with some of the resource industry’s most-respected names to add millions – and sometimes billions – of dollars to their value.Integration unites and simplifies a business to deliver a more streamlined, efficient and productive organisation. The results are quick yet sustainable; and the costs involved minimal compared with the financial results.Most businesses are unnecessarily complex. Divisions, departments, and sections all have their own agendas which are not aligned with the bigger picture or the greater good. Managers manage their own discrete area with scant regard for other sections. And management techniques vary greatly from individual to individual. It’s therefore not surprising that businesses end up fragmented and misaligned, complex and cluttered, inefficient and unprofitable.The effects of integrational alignment are truly transformational - unlocking substantial latent value for a negligible investment and driving continuous, sustainable improvement. Properly-executed integration can add billions of dollars to an organisation’s bottom line.At NextGenOpX, we have developed our own, revolutionary methodology which challenges the traditional, time-worn paradigm of mining industry practices. It delivers whole-of-business integration resulting in increased productivity and better margins. We achieve this through strategic alignment, a structured integration model, co-design and leadership mobilisation. Barriers and inefficiencies are removed; and opportunities unearthed.Some consultants adopt a do-it-our way, dictatorial approach. Not us. Our style is one of co-design, not control. We work with our clients’ leaders to build ownership, and we always engage and design with deep operational empathy.We co-create a clear business case and strategy for any change before working with you to implement it, resulting in a simpler workplace and a more focussed, accountable organisation.Our approach goes beyond current best practice to offer you sustainable, next-generation thinking.",http://www.nextgenopx.com/,,Management ConsultingProfessional ServicesProject Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NextOre,"NextOre’s Magnetic Resonance (""MR"") Analyser is a breakthrough innovation that delivers highly accurate, real-time measurements of metal concentrations in broken rock at full-scale mining production rates.
MR Analysers allow waste rock to be identified and sorted during the mining phase in order to recover more of the high-grade ore. This early sorting capability equates to a vast reduction in resources used in metal production.","NextOre was formed in 2017 for the purpose of deploying innovative technologies into the mining and minerals processing sector. NextOre is proud to present its Magnetic Resonance (""MR"") ore sorting technology, an unparalleled leader in mineral sensing technology. Fitting over industry standard conveyor belts, the MR Analyser provides near-instantaneous whole-of-ore grade measurements.These highly accurate, real-time measurements allow operations to divert waste material, resulting in higher grade and lower tonnage mill feed. NextOre’s industry-leading technology provides measurable efficiency improvements allowing mining companies to take a leap forward in environmental sustainability, site consumption, and unit costs. The technology underpinning this device is an adaptation of similar technology to that used in medical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines, developed over 15+ years by NextOre’s research and development partner, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (“CSIRO”).",http://www.nextore.com.au/,,MiningMineral Separation SystemsSensors & Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OLEOLOGY,"OLEOLOGY’s expertise in water treatment systems (incorporating MyCelx technology) offers advanced solutions to enable recycling and decontaminating water quicker, simpler, and more cost-effective. MyCelx technology efficiently removes organics, oils, hydrocarbons, mercury and PFAS to below detectable levels. OLEOLOGY’s solution is a small footprint able to remove free oil, dispersed and emulsified hydrocarbons to the environment, well below EPA requirements.","MyCelx technology is utilised by some of the TOP 500 companies for water treatment around the world. OLEOLOGY’s solution is a small footprint able to remove free oil, dispersed and emulsified hydrocarbons to the environment, well below EPA requirements.While other oil water separators (OWS) rely on mechanical separation or chemicals, MyCelx actually bonds with oil and other contaminants at a molecular level. This means oils, hydrocarbons, and other contaminants are removed almost completely without any water loss. Some of MyCelx’s many benefits are:- Oil Contaminant levels reduced to less than 5ppm (parts per million)- No release back into the water – even when saturated- Designed to meet your flow rate and discharge requirements- Easy to install, low maintenance, and cost-effective- Environmentally friendly solutionWhere Conventional Systems FailConventional systems try to remove oil and hydrocarbons from water by mechanical separation or in combination with chemical injection. That approach requires a long sequence of steps and is prone to system bottleneck and failures. When the composition or loading of oil and hydrocarbon changes, these systems can even release oil back into the stream.MyCelx doesn’t just mechanically filter or separate oil – it permanently binds with oil through molecular cohesion. Once oil comes in contact with MyCelx, it cannot be released back into the water. MyCelx provides the lowest ppm levels and smaller droplet size removal than any other system on the market.Scientific, Reliable Oil & Hydrocarbon RemovalMyCelx systems use a scientific and reliable approach for removing oil and hydrocarbons for produced and process water or wastewater recycling and reuse. MyCelx answers the call for meeting and exceeding regulations for water purity. When you are unable to meet strict enforcement levels with conventional approaches, MyCelx can help you meet or exceed those standards quickly, efficiently and at a surprisingly low cost.MyCelx is an ecologically friendly water treatment technology – protecting the environment and your operation by keeping oil where it should be: inside your production environment.Older systems rely on mechanical separation and do not meet required goals, however, MyCelx can be used as a complete replacement of conventional systems.",http://oleology.com.au/,"OLEOLOGY

Paradyn Systems,"Paradyn's Supply Chain Planning & Scheduling Software (SPSS) optimizes and streamlines the supply chain planning process with powerful process scheduling, production scheduling, and logistics planning functionality. Paradyn SPSS includes a highly graphical, intuitive Supply Chain analytics monitor, which analyzes all interactions between current inventory levels, contracts, sales forecasts, cargoes, and production schedules to create a visual simulation of your supply chain inventory.","To remain competitive in today’s challenging market, miners need to develop an integrated strategy for value creation as well as improve the coordination of operations planning across the resource supply chain.Plans for mining, processing, logistics, and marketing are difficult to align with enterprise objectives if each planning activity is developed separately instead of holistically. In practice, supply chain optimisation is only achievable through integrated planning. By integrated planning, we mean coordinated planning of decisions between mining, processing, logistics, and sales. While the importance of integrated supply chain planning is recognised, its execution is difficult without the right tools to support this process.BlendOpt is the first mathematical optimisation software tool that supports complete integrated planning of mining resource sales and supply chain strategies. Starting with a mine schedule, BlendOpt discovers strategies for how ore should be processed, blended, and allocated to different products or sales contracts with the objective of maximising profit. Mathematically optimised plans are created using predictive analytics algorithms that test millions of possible plans in search of the highest profit from the data provided.Previous mining supply chain optimisation software has historically been unable to accurately model the problem and did not contain algorithmic techniques that could solve the integrated mine planning problem in a timely fashion. In addition, any results generated were difficult to analyse, thereby limiting what insights could be gained to inform improvements to a mine’s business strategy.",https://www.paradynsystems.com/,"Paradyn Systems

Phibion Pty Ltd,"Phibion Pty Ltd provides process engineering solutions to civil engineering problems. We offer our clients low cost ‘Dewatering as a Service’ (DaaS) to reduce business and environmental risk through the application of AMC using our uniquely designed equipment, the MudMaster®.","Phibion Pty Ltd provides process engineering solutions to civil engineering problems. Originally established as a tailings management consulting service under the company name of ‘Residue Solutions’ Phibion has developed a new tailings management process called Accelerated Mechanical Consolidation (AMC) or more commonly known as ‘Mud Farming’.AMC was developed due to increased environmental constraints and reduced operational margins in the mining industry along with imported high cost flocculation and filtration technology alternatives. To fully implement AMC, Phibion has developed advanced in-situ dewatering machines, called MudMasters®.Established in the Australian alumina industry, AMC and the MudMaster®, have been applied to a range commodities and dredged materials in Australia and worldwide. We offer our clients low cost ‘Dewatering as a Service’ (DaaS) to reduce business and environmental risk through the application of AMC using our uniquely designed equipment.The MudMaster® is a customised Archimedes Screw Tractor dedicated to the Mud Farming® process. These machines are designed, engineered, fabricated in Brisbane, Australia. Through innovative design, the MudMaster® can be customised to the specific properties of the materials requiring dewatering. This ensures maximum operational efficiency and dewatering effectiveness is achieved under all conditions, delivering a safe, cost-effective and scalable solution.AMC is a process where a slurry is deposited in controlled layers in a dam and repeatedly ploughed, using the MudMaster®, to disturb the hindered settling of the profile and liberate entrained liquids. These liquids are released and drain to a designated collection point for recycling. The correct application of AMC dewaters slurries to a high density and strength, reducing the volume, and recovering water. The process can reduce the footprint and volume of materials by up to 50%, reducing capital costs, closure costs and environmental impacts across the mining industry, along with port development for land reclamation.",http://www.phibion.com/,"Phibion Pty Ltd

Pinssar,"Pinssar is the creator of an innovative world-leading continuous, real-time Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) monitoring system. This technology helps companies provide safer, healthier work environments where diesel machinery operates and hazardous particulate levels become present. It addresses the challenge for mining companies in that “you can’t monitor what you can’t measure” and “you can’t respond to hazards that are not quantified”.","Pinssar developed the world’s first continuous real-time diesel particulate monitoring (DPM) system helping companies provide safer, healthier work environments where diesel machinery operates and hazardous particulate levels are present.It was when diesel engine exhaust was declared carcinogenic by the World Health Organisation in 2012 that Pinssar founder, Francois Velge set out to develop an ultra-low maintenance DPM monitor capable of measuring emissions in the critical sub-800 nanometre particle range, where DPM exists. This innovation addresses the challenge that the construction industry has previously faced, where DPM has historically been under-monitored and not real time, with air samples requiring off-site laboratory analysis.The Pinssar solution supports the recommendations released in British Standard BS 61:64 including “real-time monitoring of DPM using light scattering technology” and “Continuous real time monitoring”. Francois is pleased that companies can now purposefully collect data about the conditions in which workers are exposed, allowing decisions to be made and DPM controls to be put in place to improve the wellbeing of workers. He is pleased to be a member of CIRIA alongside many proactive companies in the construction sector who are equally passionate about improving worker safety. He believes the message about the importance of monitoring to measure DPM can be spread throughout the OZMETs Hub network.

Productivity Development Solutions,"PDS Asset Management Software is an asset management and condition monitoring application for web, android and iOS that eliminates the need for complicated spreadsheets and inefficient hand-written reports.
PDS connects multiple work groups, captures valuable inspection data and reports all the relevant information you need in a simple, easy to read format.
PDS is a single source of truth for data capture and storage and can easily expand as your business needs evolve.","PDS ’s Mining Asset Management Software is designed to support inspections through condition data capture and using predictive analytics identify optimum time for replacement. This information is real world data unique to each particular operation. Each mine site or bulk handling facility will have its own unique environment and custom infrastructure, by collating and analysing data for that operation, maintenance teams are able to accurately determine the safe usable working life for monitored components. Comprehensive replaced assets data history, held within PDS, assists in improved decision making around related component life.The backbone of the PDS Software suite is PDS Asset which is the configuration engine for PDS’s software suite. There are four modules WEAR, IDLER, INSPECT and COMPLEX which can be used separately to manage a broad range of componentry requiring asset management inspection and maintenance.Each module has been designed in concert with our customers to capture relevant business’s data, be user friendly and present the information in an easily digestible format for relevant stakeholders. Web functionality is available, although data is typically captured in the field via phone or tablet apps for Android and iOS (in offline mode when recording data in remote areas) which then sync’s through PDS’s Cloud service. This allows customers to access all of their information in real time, rather than technicians creating Reports via manual data entry.Customer parameters are configurable and complex layouts such as transfer chute liners and screen panel decks are pictorially represented to ensure accurate identification. Alarm Points can be established, and test data trended to establish wear rates and forecast changeout dates for a variety of equipment types, typically conveyor belts, but also Pipe Wear, Apron Feeder Pans, Chains and Rollers, Truck Trays, Rail & Rail Wheels, Liners & Screen Panels. Almost any component is possible.Task based Planned Inspections, and ad-hoc Inspection capabilities allows real time capture in the field of component condition and faults.The collated data allows for better planning of maintenance and ensures key componentry is addressed during those shutdowns. There is the capability to attach photographs to specific components to allow for visualisation of defects or layouts and non-measurable changes overtime can therefore be noted.",,"Productivity Development Solutions

Reedbed Technology,"Reedbed Technology specialise in passive water treatment technologies for water, wastewater and sludge treatment. We have developed processes for Australia using plants and media to treat domestic, industrial and mining wastewater along with treatment processes for sludge (solids) produced from water treatment or other processes. Our systems are low energy, low maintenance, use natural processes to treat water to quality suitable for reuse or disposal and are ideally suited to remote locations.","Reedbed Technology specialise in passive natural treatment technologies for water treatment, wastewater treatment and sludge treatment such as reedbeds and constructed wetlands.The benefits of our systems are:- low OPEX- low energy (in some cases no energy)- low maintenance,- use natural processes to treat water to a quality suitable for reuse or disposal- ideally suited to remote locations and mining camps- use no chemicals- produce no odour- simple to construct- extremely simple to operate requiring no specialist training or engineering skills- long lifespan (20-40 years)- resilient to large changes in wastefeed (both quality and quantity)As the plants and media do most of the work, the mechanical equipment used in our system consists of valves and pumps (easily maintained and replaced where necessary with spares kept onsite). Our systems are fully automated allowing remote monitoring and operation.We have developed our treatment processes specifically for Australian conditions, using native plants and media to treat a range of wastewater including:- domestic sewage- industrial wastewater and- mining wastewater and produce water.Our domestic sewage system treats sludge and wastewater in the one system reducing the need for alternative sludge treatment or disposal. Macerated raw sewage is fed directly to our first stage reedbeds and the solids are dried in-situ (removal required once per ten years but solids content is high, around 50-60% dry solids, and easily composted). The remaining stages treat the water to remove BOD, and nutrients (N and P) as required to meet reuse or disposal requirements.We have developed processes for treatment of sludge (solids) produced from water or wastewater treatment or other industrial or mining processes which include drying and mineralisation of organic contamination. Dry solids concentrations of 50-60% w/w or greater are easily achievable and possibly higher depending on the climate.We have also developed systems suitable for groundwater remediation and treatment of mining wastewater for treatment of organic contaminants and nutrients such as ammonia. Our systems can be used for treatment of petroleum contamination such as in produce water and treatment of chlorinated organics.We are quite active in terms of R&D and are extremely good at problem solving so happy to work with you to look at other water based issues you may be having - we like a challenge.",http://www.reedbedtechnology.com/,,WaterEnvironmental Equipment & ServicesWater Equipment & Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relialytics,"At Relialytics, we improve asset reliability through the analysis of Oil Sample Reports.
Our mission is to make all your data work for you, minimise transactional processing and automate data analysis. We do this by translating the data sources into practical actions to ensure your equipment is available to work when and where you need it.","We improve your equipment reliability through the analysis of your oil sample reports and develop actionable maintenance tasks that are loaded directly into your CMMS based on all relevant data, not just the 'critical' or 'abnormal' evaluations. Save time, money and improve the condition of your equipment.From our experience we estimate that on average, 80% of data generated from oil sample reports are not fully utilised.It raises questions as to what to do with all of that data from oil sample reports that contains the full story of the condition and health of your equipment. It’s no secret that many equipment owners and maintainers will respond to ‘critical’ and ‘abnormal’ lab evaluations first, as they resolve short term issues and prevent immediate failures. This leaves the ‘normal’ evaluations that potentially hold a lot more information that can be used to increase reliability and prevent unexpected downtime in the future.Relialytics address this challenge with the ‘Equipment Condition Supervisor’ (ECS). The application has been developed with algorithms working within an extensive database containing over 20 years of data interpretation and past actions. ECS instantaneously reviews your oil sample reports and develops a list of recommended actions based on experience, precedents, and data matching. These actions can be uploaded into your CMMS for your review and approval. From there it becomes part of your maintenance workflow where you are utilising all of the relevant data. The outcome is increased planned work and reduced downtime and greater reliability in the short and long term.If you feel your site could be getting more value from your reports, get in touch and we’ll help you improve your reliability and condition monitoring.",http://relialytics.com.au/,"Relialytics Pty Ltd

Safestop,"Safestop intelligent illuminated signage has been designed to aid in the prevention of vehicle collisions
at intersections and other vehicle hazards.","In the mining industry, heavy earth moving equipment and light vehicles share the roads and interact around the clock. The outcome of a collision often results in a fatality. Vision obstructing airborne masses such as dust and fog, lack of lighting, blinding artificial lighting, operator fatigue and the lack of operator vision from the cabins of large mining equipment all contribute to the significantly higher potential for vehicle collisions at intersections. Safestop is an aiddesigned to assist vehicle operators’ judgment and ability to identify hazards.Our vision is to make Safestop the new standard in intersection signage in all industries from private enterprise through to public and civil sectors.Vehicles are detected using radar technology. By sending out pulses of radio waves the radar isable to detect the presence, direction, distance, and speed of vehicles. Surface mining operationspresent an array of harsh conditions that put the consistency and integrity of any complexelectronic device to the test. Environmental factors including wind, rain, dust, light, extremetemperatures and fog do not affect the performance of radar. Consequently, road users are leftwith a safe and reliable product that they can have confidence in.At the operational level, the Safestop radar can be adjusted to optimise its performance to suitevery scenario. Radar sensitivity can be set so a rear dump truck can be detected as far away as200 meters. To prevent false detection events, for example in a situation where a vehicle has eitherbroken down or been parked in the radars field of view, minimum detection speed can be set aslow as 8km/h.",http://www.safestop.com.au/,,MiningMine Heavy VehiclesSafety Equipment & Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SeePilot is a VR software solution that enables organisations to create their own (in-house) virtual ‘workspaces’ for clear communication - improving safety and productivity.","Communication is not always correctly understood, and if this relates to a heavy-industry workplace there can be significant safety and productivity implications. SeePilot is a VR software solution that enables organisations to create their own (in-house) virtual ‘workspaces’ for clear communication - improving safety and productivity. SeePilot improves efficiency in hazardous, dynamic, and/or remote locations by making communication spatial (360-degree). By utilising advancements in 360-degree cameras and VR technology, it is possible to intuitively communicate with someone whilst viewing a workspace, without having to be in the same workplace or communicate at the same time. SeePilot is an interactive tool where users record voice memos and draw to point out features whilst viewing the 360-degree footage. These pieces of information (scenes) can be linked together and integrated with other forms of information (eg 3D photogrammetry models) to construct a SeePilot workspace.This SeePilot workspace can be viewed through VR headsets, tablets/mobile and/or a web interface. These images/videos/models immerse the user at different locations around a worksite, for inductions, training, and workplace communication. SeePilot enables the viewer to use an interaction device (eg a VR hand controller or tablet stylus) to select elements of the scene to change location, playback pieces of information and record their own annotations. This interaction improves user attention and information retention ensuring complete communication. Through this interaction there is also the capability to record user details (eg employee ID), where they went in the experience, where they looked, and their annotations.",http://www.seepilot.com.au/,"SeePilot

SmartCap Technologies,SmartCap is a predictive fatigue monitoring system that measures an operator or driver's brain activity to calculate their level of alertness whilst operating equipment. Operators wear a baseball style cap that measures EEG through sophisticated sensors concealed in the cap lining.,"SmartCap is a predictive fatigue monitoring system that measures an operator or driver's brain activity to calculate their level of alertness whilst operating equipment. Operators wear a baseball style cap that measures EEG through sophisticated sensors concealed in the cap lining.Operator and driver fatigue is responsible for many injuries and losses in a number of industries throughout the world. SmartCap allows fatigue to be managed in a proactive way to ensure that your people go home safe each and every day. EEG or Electroencephalography is the measurement of electrical activity along the scalp and is the gold standard in sleep science. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. By measuring an operator’s brain wave (EEG) information SmartCap can calculate a measure of alertness which is wirelessly communicated to a display in-cab. SmartCap can be used to manage a person's fatigue anywhere that an operator has the potential to cause damage or harm. SmartCap saves lives by predicting when an operator is at risk of a microsleep and alerting them before they fall asleep. Road haulage, rail, transport, mining and the marine industries have all used SmartCap to keep their people safe.The technology behind the SmartCap was developed within CRCMining, a Cooperative Research Centre established by the Australian government, supported by four universities and 13 industry partners including equipment manufacturers and mining companies. SmartCap has helped drivers travel more than 17,000,000 km with more than 1,000,000 hours of operator fatigue captured. SmartCap has been independently validated by Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) and the Austin Health Institute of Breathing and Sleep (IBAS). In conjunction with a number of SmartCap users, field validation has also been performed by experts from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Chile. Installed in more than 21 operations, companies are using SmartCap as part of a comprehensive fatigue risk management solution to improve safety on site and develop strategies to support operators to proactively manage their own fatigue.",http://www.smartcaptech.com/,"SmartCap Technologies

Over 2.1B hours of learning across 1.3M machines means every day you use the platform, you benefit further. We’ve seen machines of all types, we learn every day how machines fail, how they maximise production and how to predict maintenance issues.Uptake's Asset IO is an AI-enabled Asset Performance Management application specifically designed to improve the availability and efficiency of fixed and mobile mining equipment.Customers have realised:- 4% increase in revenue output as a result of improving haul truck availability and reducing unplanned downtime that disrupts the material handling network of the operation- 5% reduction in maintenance costs through AI-enabled maintenance programs, which financially optimise preventative tasks and use machine data to deliver predictive maintenance insights- 2% reduction in fuel costs by complementing existing telematics data to optimise route and fuel efficiencyOn an average mine site with an operating budget of $170M, this yields $2.5M in annual cost reductions across repair and maintenance, fuel and tire savings. The value of revenue output is dependent on the primary commodity of a given site but you’re leaving 4% of your rated output on the table as a result of not optimising operations with AI technology on your haul trucks.How it works:First Uptake ingests data from a variety of sources. We can pull in real-time machine data, complimenting existing telematics data, we add fluids inspection reports, service data, and work order history and then combine that with our proprietary Asset Strategy Library (ASL). The ASL is a database of financially optimised preventative maintenance (PM) plans derived from decades of service data with over 55k failure modes spanning over 800 asset types.We then ingest your data on to our purpose-built AI platform.Specifically, for haul trucks we apply:- Data Cleansing engine to not only ingest data but automate preparing the data for data science- Fuel Management Engine compliments your telematics to data to optimise fuel consumption- Preventative Maintenance Suggestion combines your OEM-based PM schedules with our ASL to suggest a financially optimised PM program.- Anomaly detection on live real-time data- Failure prediction engines to your brakes, engine transmission systems",http://www.uptake.com/,"Uptake

V2H International,"V2H International has a unique, environmentally friendly method of greatly improving recovery of oil and gas from new and existing wells. The V2H International technology will safely and economically increase hydrocarbon recovery, reducing and potentially eliminating the need for hydraulic fracturing.","V2H International has developed the world’s first fully functional Radial Drilling technology. The process is a means of bypassing problematic formation damage, (which exists in every well in the world) accessing and unlocking previously unrecoverable vast reserves of oil and gas. This is achieved by entering an existing vertical well, where steel casing sizes of just 4.5” in diameter are common, and rapidly drilling (using high pressure water) horizontally, directly out from the vertical well, into the various target layers. The resulting improved connectivity to the oil/gas/coal seam gas layers dramatically increases production rates and total recovery.",http://www.2hinternational.com/,,Oil & GasDrilling Equipment & Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vayeron's innovative breakthrough technology on offer is the Smart-Idler. A Wireless, internal to the roller condition monitoring sensor device. Expressions of interest from conveyor roller manufacturers are welcome!The Smart-Idler is a wireless, low-cost, energy harvesting, consumable condition monitoring sensor device for use inside conveyor rollers/idlers. The product senses key signs that are characteristic of roller failure, including acoustic signals, vibration, and temperature. The product wirelessly transmits the sensed data 'back-to-base' for roller condition reporting so that intelligent, pre-emptive rather than reactive maintenance decisions can be made. Conveyor roller associated down-time arises either as a direct result of damage to the conveyor belt caused by unexpected catastrophic idler failure, or from pre-empting the damage that a detected failing roller can cause, with either case requiring unplanned shutdown. Primary end-users of the technology will be iron ore operations, coal operations, mineral port facilities, large non-ferrous miners and any other high value, high capacity/volume bulk materials conveyor operators.The Smart-Idler solves a large headache for conveyor operators - The tracking/monitoring and reporting of the condition of thousands of rollers in a conveyor system. This can be a costly exercise which relies on human interaction with the conveyor system (""walking the line""), and is therefore prone to human error. Consequences of missing a failure can be extremely high, however the systems for detecting them are still antiquated. The Smart-Idler technology is designed to be applicable to all large scale mining or bulk handling operations, however it will be particularly useful to Iron Ore, where conveyors regularly run at rates of 10,000 tonnes per hour (pushing the limit of capacity), and underground coal mines where statutory requirements mean that temperatures above 150 degrees Celsius are unacceptable. Through Smart-Idler It is now possible for conveyor roller condition monitoring to be a completely automated process.",http://www.vayeron.com.au/,"Vayeron

Since 1999, Whittle Consulting has conducted over 150 Whittle Enterprise Optimisation studies around the world, repeatedly demonstrating the comprehensive application of Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning & concepts from the highly regarded Money Mining Seminar, improving the economics of a mining project or operation by 15% and in many cases substantially more.With technical expertise in a range of disciplines including geology, mining engineering, metallurgy, research, mathematics, computing, finance, operational/financial modelling and analysis, Whittle Consulting has a thorough appreciation of practical, organisational and contextual reality. As experts in embracing & harnessing complexity, Whittle Consulting is not bound by traditional thinking. By challenging existing paradigms & conventional wisdom, the real potential of a mining business is revealed.Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning is a concept of long-term planning which considers:•All parts of the value chain–from the mineral resource to the market.•All periods–a decision of what to mine and process in one period affects the options for the other periods.•All stakeholders–shareholders are interested in financial returns in the form of cash flow and capital growth. However, the interests of employees, local communities, the government & the environment must be considered to earn an enduring licence to operate.A decision made at any point in the system potentially affects the optimal decision for other parts of the system. The key is to optimise all decisions simultaneously. This calls for cross-functional collaboration across all parts of the organisation–rather than a traditional silo approach (i.e. geology, mining, processing, logistics, marketing/commercial, finance and HR). This requires the application of the Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning philosophy & methodologies, combined with sophisticated optimisation technology. Only Whittle Consulting has this unique combination combining our expertise with the power of our proprietary software Prober E, the most advanced optimisation software available for the mining industry. With over 30 years of development, Prober E is a multi-thread, cloud-enabled, nonlinear, multi variable, simultaneous optimiser with the power to resolve the largest & most complex Enterprise Optimisation mining models.",http://www.whittleconsulting.com.au/,"Whittle Consulting

This has resulted in extensive experience in human factors risk and health & safety (HS) management which has been demonstrated in academic, clinical and industrial environments.Experience stemmed from an initial Masters degree in biomechanics which progressed to an academic career in anatomy & biomechanics primarily in rehabilitation & occupational health, lecturing at both Australian and British Universities. This initial training in biomechanics flowed onto work in ergonomics, human factors engineering and other safety related disciplines. This training was of particular importance when considering the large proportion of costs in any organisation that can be traced back to incidents involving a mismatch in human-machine-environment interaction design, which biomechanics attempts to redress.An academic role was followed by a consulting role with a range of experience in heavy industry such as mining, oil and gas, utilities & chemical, transport (aviation, road, rail & maritime). Julie has since worked in a variety of capacities for union and government organisations, regulators as well as international consulting firms. Consulting work has included extensive involvement in FEED/EPCM in greenfield and brownfield engineering projects.She has been involved in the setup of major engineering multi country multi site projects across the Asia- Pacific region providing human factors & HSSE advice & workshop facilitation such as developing of HSSE risk management systems including diagnosis of HS, HR & security & environment issues, strategy/plan development, implementation, monitoring & review.Julie is also employed by a variety of law firms throughout Asia Pacific to provide expert opinion.
