Our system does not require any maintenance after installed and has a low Total Cost of Ownership.Conventional fire detection technologies are not the most effective in the rugged conditions at a mine and incur prohibitive costs for supply, installation and constant maintenance. The result has been poor performance of mine fire detection systems and, in many cases, no fire detection at all. This scenario puts personnel and valuable equipment at risk. Advanced Photonics Australia provides innovative Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology to detect the earliest warning signs of fire (e.g. smouldering coal) over large areas, enabling critical action to avoid irreversible fire events.Our fibre optic cable monitoring provides the following key features:- 24\u00d77 remote temperature monitoring of the entire length, for total coverage.- Provides exact location and temperature of the fire or abnormal conditions.- It provides early warning of heat before a flame occurs.- Requires no maintenance after it is installed.- Accredited for fire detection use (flame resistance 750\u00b0C for 2 hours, IEC 60331)- Doesn\u2019t propagate the flame along the cable (IEC60332-3).- Can be installed in harsh environments (stainless steel cable sheath with high crush resistance).- Is immune to EMI (electromagnetic interference).- The fibre cable is the sensor, no other cabling or field interface devices required.",

This shift to the cloud, helps companies deliver operational insight, condition-based maintenance, data integration as well as improved customer experience initiatives such as field mobility, digital twins and natural language interfaces.",
        "description": "The mining industry represents a large and growing segment of AWS customers. Examples include Operators such as Rio Tinto, Oz Minerals, and Barrick Gold, and METS leaders such as Siemens, Esri, OSIsoft, Trimble and Schneider Electric.Operators are looking to predictive analytics to generate insight across operations and find further productivity gains that allow them to either mine more material, or to reduce the assets they need to maintain current mining levels.We are focusing on the 5 key initiatives for the mining vertical:1. Helping mining companies build integrated data platforms to provide a single view of operations, fusion between disparate datasets, data discovery and provide tools for analytics2. Helping mining companies derive insight upstream in the value chain - a deeper understanding of the ore-body, intelligent drilling, fragmentation analysis and modelling stockpile value3. A scalable platform for system-wide optimization and scenario planning, allowing Operators to perform discrete event simulation, Monte Carlo analysis and \u2018what-if\u2019 planning associated with major projects, operating model changes or daily operations4. Accelerating connected and autonomous mining for Operators and reducing OEM dependence through the use of a common platform (from the edge to the cloud), modern AI engines and open data on advanced GPU instances, elastic infrastructure, and Amazon SageMaker for machine learning lifecycle management5. Accelerate digital transformations by running SAP environments on AWS. AWS can help Operators move faster, operate more securely, and save substantial costs; all while benefiting from the scale and performance of SAP in the cloud.Key benefits of AWS for mining use-cases are: a) Innovation: Harness the power of elastic cloud computing, big data, analytics, and machine learning to extract insights from data and bring unusual value to the enterprise, more timely decisions or plant optimizations, b) Speed and Agility: rapidly design, provision, and deploy new capability into highly functional and beneficial enterprise domains, and c) Economics: pay-as-you go, elastic and serverless computing models reduce the cost of running infrastructure and require minimum upfront investments.",

Our reliability experts develop whole-of-life models including design verification, optimised maintenance plans, budget forecasts, risk evaluations, resource requirements, PM and work instruction document generation and auto loading of maintenance plans to asset management systems. For existing plants, our ability to model and optimise plant performance leads to immediate and direct results both operationally and on the bottom line.Asset Strategy Management - A holistic, consistent and standardised approach to managing your asset strategies, organisation-wide. Physical assets and independent sites are connected to a central system, allowing you to effectively develop, implement, maintain and optimise asset strategies. Implementing an ASM program ensures that optimal strategies are always deployed, quickly and efficiently, resulting in the reduction of failures, downtime and risk, and as a consequence, a lower cost of operations.Maintenance Strategy Development and Optimisation - Maintenance strategies developed using the principles of RCM on critical assets ensures that the right maintenance is specified at the optimum interval. Application of generic maintenance plans from library models ensures that plans are developed efficiently in an appropriate time frame.Life Cycle Costing - Analysing the cost of an asset over its lifetime can be an important element for assessing different potential solutions before the project begins, including developing a maintenance budget. It is also useful in analysing whether to repair or replace an asset. We can provide expert support for estimating your life cycle costs and can assist with business case preparation for large capital expenditure proposals.RAMS Studies - Not sure where to begin with reliability improvement or cost reduction? A high-level RAMS study will provide the direction you need.

Our products thrive in complex, industrial environments where it is critical to optimize the asset design, operation and maintenance lifecycle. AspenTech uniquely combines decades of process modeling expertise with machine learning. Our purpose-built software platform automates knowledge work and builds sustainable competitive advantage by delivering high returns over the entire asset lifecycle. As a result, companies in capital-intensive industries can maximize uptime and push the limits of performance, running their assets faster, safer, longer and greener.By using real machine learning with normal, abnormal, and failure signature agents, damage can be prevented. Looming issues can be seen weeks or even months earlier to allow for more time for investigation and planning with Aspen Mtell\u00ae. Not only that, Mtell can see things other solutions cannot to prevent process-induced damage. More importantly, Mtell attaches a failure to a specific root cause which guides operations and maintenance leaders directly to the fix. With the numerous moving parts within the continuous casting process, challenging and expensive equipment failures have occurred. The turret, oscillating mold, cooling chamber, induction stirrer, and numerous rollers must be working within specified parameters or serious problems could arise and severely impact earnings and possibly the safety of employees. Future occurrences can be avoided with early detection and detailed prescriptive analytics provided by machine learning.Aspen Fidelis Reliability\u2122 is a reliability, availability and maintainability tool built on a digital twin of the process at mines, mills and refineries. This solution is uniquely designed to model all equipment assets and process flows to effectively determine asset utilization, overall equipment effectiveness and other parameters that define operating conditions, reliability and costs of assets.Aspen ProMV\u2122 delivers multivariate analysis tailored to the unique needs of continuous and batch processing that is found in mines with flotation and recovery as well as metal refineries. As ore changes with each block or polygon extracted, flotation and recovery can be adapted based on the chemical composition of the slurry. Recovery can be enhanced by specific changes in stirrer tip speed, supply feed flow-rate, tailings flow-rate, and air supply that reduce process variability.",

        "description": "Big Tyre is a specialist in wheel design and manufacture providing solutions to meet mining\u2019s harshest conditions. Established in Australia over 65 years ago and manufacturing solid wheels for underground mining applications for over 20 years, Big Tyre is well equipped to meet your requirements.For slow moving applications (less than 20km\/hr), solid wheels have numerous advantages over pneumatic tyres. Advantages include:\u2022 Safety \u2013 no explosion risk during fitting or when in use.\u2022 Reliability \u2013 sharp rocks, bolts and other obstacles that would destroy a pneumatic tyre through side wall or tread damage are not a problem for a solid wheel.\u2022 Increased load capacity \u2013 pneumatic tyres typically can\u2019t carry the kind of loads required within the space restrictions of underground mining. Using pneumatic tyres in an overload situation will lead to premature failure potentially evidenced as sidewall splitting and or tread separation.\u2022 Customised ground clearance \u2013 whether you need minimal ground clearance to bring your equipment down a low clearance entrance to the mine or even elevated clearance due to the terrain within the mine, solid wheels can be built to suit the application.\u2022 Low ground pressure \u2013 although you might not imagine it, solid wheels can actually be designed to give a lower ground pressure than a pneumatic for a given size and load capacity requirement.\u2022 Other customisable options \u2013 this includes the tread pattern based on your site requirements, high quality European chain fitment, chain guard to prevent wheel chains from slipping onto and damaging the brake line, stainless components to prevent the wheel from seizing onto the machine in corrosive environments.\u2022 Cost efficiency \u2013 due to their increased reliability (removing expensive downtime) and longer life (more rubber to wear down), solid wheels are the most cost-effective solution for many operations.Big Tyre\u2019s wheels are built from the highest quality rubber we can source, and different rubber compounds are available depending on the application. Combining high quality materials and our world class techniques and processes enables Big Tyre to build wheels that are second to none. This quality is backed up with our 2-year warranty that even has extension options available. Our solid wheels are shipped to over 50 countries around the world and we are the preferred supplier to several leading original equipment manufacturers.",

They can also handle hot and stressful environments. The arms have a long reach, and a wide range of attachments increase the machines\u2019 flexibility and applications.Brokk\u2019s machines are sold to a large number of countries globally and are used in many areas of application. In addition to demolition, Brokk\u2019s machines are used for renovation of cement kilns, removal of linings as well as other purposes. As the machines can be remote-controlled, they are suitable for use in elevated-risk environments such as nuclear power plants and for handling contaminated materials.Brokk takes mining to a new levelBelow ground, the advantage of a compact, remote-controlled demolition robot becomes abundantly clear. It provides the same breaking capacity as larger traditional mining machines. Brokk means power, safety and a wide range of profit-enhancing tools.The Brokk demolition robot excels in versatility. The same machine can perform a variety of tasks, such as scaling, breaking, digging, drilling, secondary breaking, bottom shaft cleaning etc. And the three-arm system enables all this with unparalleled reach and stability.Thanks to remote, radio-controlled handling, the operator can overlook the job from a safe, comfortable position with no risk of injury from falling debris. The electric motor provides strong, quiet power with no exhaust fumes or other hazardous pollutants or vibration. Load-balanced outriggers provide excellent machine stability in all working directions while the sturdy track system and well protected cylinders make the Brokk extremely durable and easy to maintain.Above ground, the Brokk machine proves its value in the processing of material, when used in the maintenance of kilns, crushers etc. Typical applications include refractory removal and oversize breaking. So above ground or below ground, Brokk is the preferred choice for many mines.",

        "description": "Clean Oil Services Pty Ltd commenced business in 1996 as an independent Oil Analysis Laboratory. Our laboratory services clients in many industries including mining, heavy industry, Oil &Gas, transport and power.Many oil samples we test are taken from very large oil compartments, holding hundreds or thousands of litres of oil. We often recommended the common practice that oil be changed out and disposed of, because it was contaminated with wear metals, dust or water.The huge cost of this waste, as well as the negative environmental impact made us look for alternate solutions and over time we designed a machine capable of removing contamination easily, economically and quickly, to extend oil life without having to shut productive machinery down.Our first LUBEMASTER was patented in 2003 and we have continued to innovate and design for various applications.Equipment and the maintenance and lubrication of equipment, is a major cost to industry. Our vision is to keep the oil in perfect condition while it is in service and remove the need of changing oil for a significantly extended period, or even at all. In today\u2019s economic environment, there is no room for unnecessary costs and inefficient management of resources.The cost of manufacturing in Australia is becoming prohibitive and many other industries including mining and power are looking to reduce their production costs. Just doubling the oil hours results in an immediate cost savings of 50% on new oil purchases.Lubemaster oil cleaning units are unlike any other units currently available. The Lubemaster is based on centrifuge over a vacuum system, and cleans oil to cleaner than new oil specs without issues with blocked elements due to particles larger than the element pore size.Our Lubemaster range includes:\u2022 Lubemaster standard c\/w 300L tank, air vacuum, 70 lpm centrifuge, fully mobile.\u2022 Lubemaster Transformer model incorporates F\/E filtration to remove acid from oil\u2022 Lubemaster mill unit \u2013 suits crushing mills on mining sites\u2022 Lubemaster Upright \u2013 easy to manoeuvre in small spaces\u2022 Lubemaster EXD \u2013 certified for use in volatile environments\u2022 Wastemaster \u2013cleans large volumes of waste oil for re-use.

        "description": "Credenxia PLC is a leading-edge technology company that has developed a transformative online cloud-based solution for corporate identity and credential verification. The low-cost platform allows organisations and individuals to achieve compliance faster and more efficiently than existing software products and makes risk mitigation simpler by verifying that a worker has the requisite qualifications and licenses required for a specific position.The market is driven by large-scale enterprises facing significant liabilities from incidents involving uncredentialled and untrained workers in a more transient workforce. Current solutions are fragmented, inefficient, have massive costs and do not eliminate risks, unlike the transformative and proven Credenxia offering.Credenxia ensures workers are identified, verified and have all the credentials they need for the required task.We achieve this by:Proof of identity - Identity is checked against government databases, ensuring the employee is who they say they are.Biometrics - We use a 12 point facial recognition system compared against a government-issued documents to further verify the employee identity.Extensive verification process - Each uploaded credential is verified back to the issuing authority for legitimacy.Risk mitigation - Our employee verification process removes the risk of credential non-compliance before a worker gets to site.Spanning industries including government, healthcare, transport, construction and resources, Credenxia is trusted by some of the strongest brands and their workers. Our mission is to simplify management of the workforce.We want to take away the risk, guesswork, spreadsheets and emails out of the verification process. We want to increase value and productivity, while removing costs. Value means more time producing, and less time checking. More time doing, and less time organising.Our response to COVID-19With mortality rates, economic issues, and the overwhelming financial challenges of COVID-19, Credenxia have now developed an electronic platform based on our extensive experience in managing workforces across the world, making it easier for people to get back to work safely.

        "description": "Mines are often located in extremely remote regions with little or no access to fresh surface water. As a result, mining operations are often limited to using ground water for everything from potable water for accommodation camps, through to flushing and down hole water systems used in drilling applications. Ground water typically has a very high mineral count. Calcium and other salts often precipitate out of the water causing fouling which leads to reduced pressure and flow and subsequent increased maintenance and\/or equipment failure.This highly mineralised water causes ongoing problems for asset owners across the mines processes and infrastructure. Traditionally lime scale build up is removed by either chemical or mechanical means. Ecosoft Water Conditioners provide the chemical and maintenance free solution to problems associated with hard water.Typical applications where Ecosoft Water Conditioners can reduce system maintenance and increase equipment life cycle include: Blast Hole Drill Rigs, Jumbos, Cooling Towers, Heat Exchangers, Evaporative Coolers, Hot Water Systems, Accommodation, De-Watering, Commercial Kitchens, Ice Rooms etc",

The company is also capable to develop and has a successful track record in delivering complex customized solutions to new customer automation needs. We have fully fledged internally developed simulation environments \/ digital twins available for custom developments.Our ultra-low maintenance sensor instrumentation is custom designed for deployment in harsh environments and provides high resolution three dimensional data independent of lighting conditions that eliminates the risk of detection errors typical for competing systems.Product Selection:3DReclaimOur flagship product 3DReclaim is tailor made for reclaimers in use in stockyards of iron ore, coal, and other mining or bulk material handling facilities. It uses our patented machine vision control system and has been proven in a range of customer installations to dramatically improve reclaimer performance in comparison to conventional PLC based methods. 3DReclaim actively scans stockpile volume ahead of the bucket wheel in real time to directly control the reclaim process with the world\u2019s first truly volume based controller. The system optimizes face up and end of bench sequences and controls the slew turnaround to minimize unproductive air digging. It also prevents downtime through bogging events typical for conventional control operations.3DPortGuard3DPortGuard is our company\u2019s solution for port operators looking to stay in control of a ship\u2019s movements while approaching, departing, or mooring at a berth. As for all Frontier Automation control systems, it uses machine vision to automatically detect and track in real time shipping vessels within range of a berth by providing information on critical distances to mooring infrastructure, on vessel speed, and on vessel movement directions and orientations. This data is used by pilot or port operators to maintain control of a safe mooring or departure procedure or to establish root causes during incident investigations.Our dedicated drift detection algorithm allows bulk material or any other loading terminals to ensure safe operation and to avoid very costly damages to loading or port infrastructure or through spills by facilitating automated alarms and shutdowns in case a vessel exceeds safe loading movement parameters or breaks its moorings.",

Early projects were directed towards dozer attenuation and cladding of coal washeries and woodchip mill buildings.HushClad sound attenuated cladding has been installed on a number of wood chip mills, coal washery and quarry buildings, including Mt Pleasant CHPP, Centennial Springvale CPP, Ulan West Sizer Station and transfer houses, and Hunter Quarries crushing plant buildings.In early 2016, Hushpak became a wholly owned subsidiary of Advitech Holdings P\/L and has focused its efforts on products for noise attenuation of mobile machines. Custom written software allows Hushpak to design muffler systems that provide superior sound attenuation with minimal back pressure on the engine.The superior performance of Hushpak mufflers has allowed some customers to achieve noise compliance of machines without spending large amounts of capital on other attenuation equipment. They have also provided better machine performance through the hot summer months and lower fuel usage.Hushpak has developed cost effective sound attenuation packages for around 20 different mobile machine models.These include a range of haul trucks, service carts, excavators, dozers, wheel loaders and drill rigs.",

        "description": "Mineral and energy resources contributed ~50% of Australia\u2019s exports and ~7% of GDP in 2017-2018. The future of this contribution is at risk due to the trend of the declining discovery of significant, new mineral deposits. The Council of Australian Governments has captured the challenge to Australian mining: \u201cnew greenfield discoveries are urgently required to ensure that an ongoing pipeline of mineral resource projects are available to meet future demands. Australia\u2019s attractiveness as an exploration destination has been diminished by a range of factors including;perceptions of Australia as a mature exploration destination where there are fewer opportunities for new discoveries;challenges in exploring for deposits buried under the overlying sand, soil and sediment that covers much of Australia.\u201dThere are few, if any, remaining major, new mineral deposits that are exposed at the Earth\u2019s surface remaining to be found in Australia. The technical challenge of cost-effectively finding major, new mineral deposits hidden beneath barren cover rocks has not yet been met. Consequently, mineral exploration is moving from Australia to less well-explored countries with Australia\u2019s share of global mineral exploration reducing from ~1\/4 in the 1990s to ~1\/8th currently.In order to reverse this trend, we require a new set of exploration tools and new ways to deploy those tools which recognise the fundamental importance of collecting quantity and quality data from the subsurface. Collecting these data requires drilling.MinEx CRC\u2019s research includes:Developing more productive, safer and environmentally-friendly drilling methods to discover and drill-out deposits, including coiled tubing drilling technology.Developing new technologies for collecting data while drilling, bringing forward mine production.Implementation of a National Drilling Initiative (NDI) - a world-first collaboration of Geological Surveys, researchers and industry that will undertake drilling in under-explored areas of potential mineral wealth in Australia.",

For the industry to still be sustainable, we see that it is essential for the industry to reconsider and re-evaluate how they use all their water resources.New H2O have developed mobile water treatment plants that can be scaled in number and easily located to suit the mine\u2019s needs and size. The filtration plants have a range of water qualities that they can treat to provide an Environment Authority approved discharge quality capability or be used to row feed or crops on suitable irrigated fields adjacent to the mines.New H2O\u2019s technology range offers not only a cost reduction to mines, but is also a revenue stream for mines to provide water for other industries and with the local rural community. The mobile plants rather than the larger fixed infrastructure we see at the moment, allow flexibility and also enable the plant to move with the needs of the mining operations waste water storage facilities. Other technology focuses on measuring the evaporation losses on this valuable resource and provide solutions to minimising evaporation losses that could be as high as 10-14% of total water stored.Over the last 20 years, increased knowledge and concern around the climate change has generated a rise in activism for eco warriors. However, there is a solution for the mining industry and government to reduce their financial exposure and still provide a better business and community solution to a more efficient use of water.Neglecting this issue will hurt government, businesses and communities as water becomes an increasingly valuable commodity. This has occurred in a several areas around the world. Note what happened in Capetown South Africa in 2018 when it almost ran out of water.Environmental assurance bonds are costly, and New H2O Resources see water as a tradeable commodity that will drive new business and value opportunity for water use, agriculture and other ventures around old mining areas.New H2O can provide a range of opportunities for the mining, agriculture and rural sectors.

        "description": "Global leaders in integrated operationsIn an increasingly complex and competitive world, the secret to improved productivity and profitability is INTEGRATION. NextGenOpX is a global leader in integrated operations and has worked with some of the resource industry\u2019s most-respected names to add millions \u2013 and sometimes billions \u2013 of dollars to their value.Integration unites and simplifies a business to deliver a more streamlined, efficient and productive organisation. The results are quick yet sustainable; and the costs involved minimal compared with the financial results.Most businesses are unnecessarily complex. Divisions, departments, and sections all have their own agendas which are not aligned with the bigger picture or the greater good. Managers manage their own discrete area with scant regard for other sections. And management techniques vary greatly from individual to individual. It\u2019s therefore not surprising that businesses end up fragmented and misaligned, complex and cluttered, inefficient and unprofitable.The effects of integrational alignment are truly transformational - unlocking substantial latent value for a negligible investment and driving continuous, sustainable improvement. Properly-executed integration can add billions of dollars to an organisation\u2019s bottom line.At NextGenOpX, we have developed our own, revolutionary methodology which challenges the traditional, time-worn paradigm of mining industry practices. It delivers whole-of-business integration resulting in increased productivity and better margins. We achieve this through strategic alignment, a structured integration model, co-design and leadership mobilisation. Barriers and inefficiencies are removed; and opportunities unearthed.Some consultants adopt a do-it-our way, dictatorial approach. Not us. Our style is one of co-design, not control. We work with our clients\u2019 leaders to build ownership, and we always engage and design with deep operational empathy.We co-create a clear business case and strategy for any change before working with you to implement it, resulting in a simpler workplace and a more focussed, accountable organisation.Our approach goes beyond current best practice to offer you sustainable, next-generation thinking.",

OLEOLOGY\u2019s solution is a small footprint able to remove free oil, dispersed and emulsified hydrocarbons to the environment, well below EPA requirements.While other oil water separators (OWS) rely on mechanical separation or chemicals, MyCelx actually bonds with oil and other contaminants at a molecular level. This means oils, hydrocarbons, and other contaminants are removed almost completely without any water loss. Some of MyCelx\u2019s many benefits are:- Oil Contaminant levels reduced to less than 5ppm (parts per million)- No release back into the water \u2013 even when saturated- Designed to meet your flow rate and discharge requirements- Easy to install, low maintenance, and cost-effective- Environmentally friendly solutionWhere Conventional Systems FailConventional systems try to remove oil and hydrocarbons from water by mechanical separation or in combination with chemical injection. That approach requires a long sequence of steps and is prone to system bottleneck and failures. When the composition or loading of oil and hydrocarbon changes, these systems can even release oil back into the stream.MyCelx doesn\u2019t just mechanically filter or separate oil \u2013 it permanently binds with oil through molecular cohesion. Once oil comes in contact with MyCelx, it cannot be released back into the water. MyCelx provides the lowest ppm levels and smaller droplet size removal than any other system on the market.Scientific, Reliable Oil & Hydrocarbon RemovalMyCelx systems use a scientific and reliable approach for removing oil and hydrocarbons for produced and process water or wastewater recycling and reuse. MyCelx answers the call for meeting and exceeding regulations for water purity. When you are unable to meet strict enforcement levels with conventional approaches, MyCelx can help you meet or exceed those standards quickly, efficiently and at a surprisingly low cost.MyCelx is an ecologically friendly water treatment technology \u2013 protecting the environment and your operation by keeping oil where it should be: inside your production environment.Older systems rely on mechanical separation and do not meet required goals, however, MyCelx can be used as a complete replacement of conventional systems.",

        "description": "To remain competitive in today\u2019s challenging market, miners need to develop an integrated strategy for value creation as well as improve the coordination of operations planning across the resource supply chain.Plans for mining, processing, logistics, and marketing are difficult to align with enterprise objectives if each planning activity is developed separately instead of holistically. In practice, supply chain optimisation is only achievable through integrated planning. By integrated planning, we mean coordinated planning of decisions between mining, processing, logistics, and sales. While the importance of integrated supply chain planning is recognised, its execution is difficult without the right tools to support this process.BlendOpt is the first mathematical optimisation software tool that supports complete integrated planning of mining resource sales and supply chain strategies. Starting with a mine schedule, BlendOpt discovers strategies for how ore should be processed, blended, and allocated to different products or sales contracts with the objective of maximising profit. Mathematically optimised plans are created using predictive analytics algorithms that test millions of possible plans in search of the highest profit from the data provided.Previous mining supply chain optimisation software has historically been unable to accurately model the problem and did not contain algorithmic techniques that could solve the integrated mine planning problem in a timely fashion.

Originally established as a tailings management consulting service under the company name of \u2018Residue Solutions\u2019 Phibion has developed a new tailings management process called Accelerated Mechanical Consolidation (AMC) or more commonly known as \u2018Mud Farming\u2019.AMC was developed due to increased environmental constraints and reduced operational margins in the mining industry along with imported high cost flocculation and filtration technology alternatives. To fully implement AMC, Phibion has developed advanced in-situ dewatering machines, called MudMasters\u00ae.Established in the Australian alumina industry, AMC and the MudMaster\u00ae, have been applied to a range commodities and dredged materials in Australia and worldwide. We offer our clients low cost \u2018Dewatering as a Service\u2019 (DaaS) to reduce business and environmental risk through the application of AMC using our uniquely designed equipment.The MudMaster\u00ae is a customised Archimedes Screw Tractor dedicated to the Mud Farming\u00ae process. These machines are designed, engineered, fabricated in Brisbane, Australia. Through innovative design, the MudMaster\u00ae can be customised to the specific properties of the materials requiring dewatering. This ensures maximum operational efficiency and dewatering effectiveness is achieved under all conditions, delivering a safe, cost-effective and scalable solution.AMC is a process where a slurry is deposited in controlled layers in a dam and repeatedly ploughed, using the MudMaster\u00ae, to disturb the hindered settling of the profile and liberate entrained liquids. These liquids are released and drain to a designated collection point for recycling. The correct application of AMC dewaters slurries to a high density and strength, reducing the volume, and recovering water. The process can reduce the footprint and volume of materials by up to 50%, reducing capital costs, closure costs and environmental impacts across the mining industry, along with port development for land reclamation.",

This innovation addresses the challenge that the construction industry has previously faced, where DPM has historically been under-monitored and not real time, with air samples requiring off-site laboratory analysis.The Pinssar solution supports the recommendations released in British Standard BS 61:64 including \u201creal-time monitoring of DPM using light scattering technology\u201d and \u201cContinuous real time monitoring\u201d. Francois is pleased that companies can now purposefully collect data about the conditions in which workers are exposed, allowing decisions to be made and DPM controls to be put in place to improve the wellbeing of workers. He is pleased to be a member of CIRIA alongside many proactive companies in the construction sector who are equally passionate about improving worker safety.

Comprehensive replaced assets data history, held within PDS, assists in improved decision making around related component life.The backbone of the PDS Software suite is PDS Asset which is the configuration engine for PDS\u2019s software suite. There are four modules WEAR, IDLER, INSPECT and COMPLEX which can be used separately to manage a broad range of componentry requiring asset management inspection and maintenance.Each module has been designed in concert with our customers to capture relevant business\u2019s data, be user friendly and present the information in an easily digestible format for relevant stakeholders. Web functionality is available, although data is typically captured in the field via phone or tablet apps for Android and iOS (in offline mode when recording data in remote areas) which then sync\u2019s through PDS\u2019s Cloud service. This allows customers to access all of their information in real time, rather than technicians creating Reports via manual data entry.Customer parameters are configurable and complex layouts such as transfer chute liners and screen panel decks are pictorially represented to ensure accurate identification. Alarm Points can be established, and test data trended to establish wear rates and forecast changeout dates for a variety of equipment types, typically conveyor belts, but also Pipe Wear, Apron Feeder Pans, Chains and Rollers, Truck Trays, Rail & Rail Wheels, Liners & Screen Panels. Almost any component is possible.Task based Planned Inspections, and ad-hoc Inspection capabilities allows real time capture in the field of component condition and faults.The collated data allows for better planning of maintenance and ensures key componentry is addressed during those shutdowns.

Macerated raw sewage is fed directly to our first stage reedbeds and the solids are dried in-situ (removal required once per ten years but solids content is high, around 50-60% dry solids, and easily composted). The remaining stages treat the water to remove BOD, and nutrients (N and P) as required to meet reuse or disposal requirements.We have developed processes for treatment of sludge (solids) produced from water or wastewater treatment or other industrial or mining processes which include drying and mineralisation of organic contamination. Dry solids concentrations of 50-60% w\/w or greater are easily achievable and possibly higher depending on the climate.We have also developed systems suitable for groundwater remediation and treatment of mining wastewater for treatment of organic contaminants and nutrients such as ammonia. Our systems can be used for treatment of petroleum contamination such as in produce water and treatment of chlorinated organics.We are quite active in terms of R&D and are extremely good at problem solving so happy to work with you to look at other water based issues you may be having - we like a challenge.",

        "description": "We improve your equipment reliability through the analysis of your oil sample reports and develop actionable maintenance tasks that are loaded directly into your CMMS based on all relevant data, not just the 'critical' or 'abnormal' evaluations. Save time, money and improve the condition of your equipment.From our experience we estimate that on average, 80% of data generated from oil sample reports are not fully utilised.It raises questions as to what to do with all of that data from oil sample reports that contains the full story of the condition and health of your equipment. It\u2019s no secret that many equipment owners and maintainers will respond to \u2018critical\u2019 and \u2018abnormal\u2019 lab evaluations first, as they resolve short term issues and prevent immediate failures. This leaves the \u2018normal\u2019 evaluations that potentially hold a lot more information that can be used to increase reliability and prevent unexpected downtime in the future.Relialytics address this challenge with the \u2018Equipment Condition Supervisor\u2019 (ECS). The application has been developed with algorithms working within an extensive database containing over 20 years of data interpretation and past actions. ECS instantaneously reviews your oil sample reports and develops a list of recommended actions based on experience, precedents, and data matching. These actions can be uploaded into your CMMS for your review and approval. From there it becomes part of your maintenance workflow where you are utilising all of the relevant data. The outcome is increased planned work and reduced downtime and greater reliability in the short and long term.If you feel your site could be getting more value from your reports, get in touch and we\u2019ll help you improve your reliability and condition monitoring.",

SeePilot is a VR software solution that enables organisations to create their own (in-house) virtual \u2018workspaces\u2019 for clear communication - improving safety and productivity. SeePilot improves efficiency in hazardous, dynamic, and\/or remote locations by making communication spatial (360-degree). By utilising advancements in 360-degree cameras and VR technology, it is possible to intuitively communicate with someone whilst viewing a workspace, without having to be in the same workplace or communicate at the same time. SeePilot is an interactive tool where users record voice memos and draw to point out features whilst viewing the 360-degree footage. These pieces of information (scenes) can be linked together and integrated with other forms of information (eg 3D photogrammetry models) to construct a SeePilot workspace.This SeePilot workspace can be viewed through VR headsets, tablets\/mobile and\/or a web interface. These images\/videos\/models immerse the user at different locations around a worksite, for inductions, training, and workplace communication. SeePilot enables the viewer to use an interaction device (eg a VR hand controller or tablet stylus) to select elements of the scene to change location, playback pieces of information and record their own annotations. This interaction improves user attention and information retention ensuring complete communication. Through this interaction there is also the capability to record user details (eg employee ID), where they went in the experience, where they looked, and their annotations.",

Operators wear a baseball style cap that measures EEG through sophisticated sensors concealed in the cap lining.Operator and driver fatigue is responsible for many injuries and losses in a number of industries throughout the world. SmartCap allows fatigue to be managed in a proactive way to ensure that your people go home safe each and every day. EEG or Electroencephalography is the measurement of electrical activity along the scalp and is the gold standard in sleep science. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. By measuring an operator\u2019s brain wave (EEG) information SmartCap can calculate a measure of alertness which is wirelessly communicated to a display in-cab. SmartCap can be used to manage a person's fatigue anywhere that an operator has the potential to cause damage or harm. SmartCap saves lives by predicting when an operator is at risk of a microsleep and alerting them before they fall asleep. Road haulage, rail, transport, mining and the marine industries have all used SmartCap to keep their people safe.The technology behind the SmartCap was developed within CRCMining, a Cooperative Research Centre established by the Australian government, supported by four universities and 13 industry partners including equipment manufacturers and mining companies. SmartCap has helped drivers travel more than 17,000,000 km with more than 1,000,000 hours of operator fatigue captured. SmartCap has been independently validated by Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) and the Austin Health Institute of Breathing and Sleep (IBAS). In conjunction with a number of SmartCap users, field validation has also been performed by experts from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Chile. Installed in more than 21 operations, companies are using SmartCap as part of a comprehensive fatigue risk management solution to improve safety on site and develop strategies to support operators to proactively manage their own fatigue.",

        "description": "Vayeron is an OEM company supplying the roller manufacturing industry. Vayeron's innovative breakthrough technology on offer is the Smart-Idler. A Wireless, internal to the roller condition monitoring sensor device. Expressions of interest from conveyor roller manufacturers are welcome!The Smart-Idler is a wireless, low-cost, energy harvesting, consumable condition monitoring sensor device for use inside conveyor rollers\/idlers. The product senses key signs that are characteristic of roller failure, including acoustic signals, vibration, and temperature. The product wirelessly transmits the sensed data 'back-to-base' for roller condition reporting so that intelligent, pre-emptive rather than reactive maintenance decisions can be made. Conveyor roller associated down-time arises either as a direct result of damage to the conveyor belt caused by unexpected catastrophic idler failure, or from pre-empting the damage that a detected failing roller can cause, with either case requiring unplanned shutdown. Primary end-users of the technology will be iron ore operations, coal operations, mineral port facilities, large non-ferrous miners and any other high value, high capacity\/volume bulk materials conveyor operators.The Smart-Idler solves a large headache for conveyor operators - The tracking\/monitoring and reporting of the condition of thousands of rollers in a conveyor system. This can be a costly exercise which relies on human interaction with the conveyor system (\"walking the line\"), and is therefore prone to human error. Consequences of missing a failure can be extremely high, however the systems for detecting them are still antiquated. The Smart-Idler technology is designed to be applicable to all large scale mining or bulk handling operations, however it will be particularly useful to Iron Ore, where conveyors regularly run at rates of 10,000 tonnes per hour (pushing the limit of capacity), and underground coal mines where statutory requirements mean that temperatures above 150 degrees Celsius are unacceptable. Through Smart-Idler It is now possible for conveyor roller condition monitoring to be a completely automated process.",

        "description": "Whittle Consulting is a group of highly experienced industry specialists, who are passionate about adding value to mining businesses. Since 1999, Whittle Consulting has conducted over 150 Whittle Enterprise Optimisation studies around the world, repeatedly demonstrating the comprehensive application of Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning & concepts from the highly regarded Money Mining Seminar, improving the economics of a mining project or operation by 15% and in many cases substantially more.With technical expertise in a range of disciplines including geology, mining engineering, metallurgy, research, mathematics, computing, finance, operational\/financial modelling and analysis, Whittle Consulting has a thorough appreciation of practical, organisational and contextual reality. As experts in embracing & harnessing complexity, Whittle Consulting is not bound by traditional thinking. By challenging existing paradigms & conventional wisdom, the real potential of a mining business is revealed.Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning is a concept of long-term planning which considers:\u2022All parts of the value chain\u2013from the mineral resource to the market.\u2022All periods\u2013a decision of what to mine and process in one period affects the options for the other periods.\u2022All stakeholders\u2013shareholders are interested in financial returns in the form of cash flow and capital growth. However, the interests of employees, local communities, the government & the environment must be considered to earn an enduring licence to operate.A decision made at any point in the system potentially affects the optimal decision for other parts of the system. The key is to optimise all decisions simultaneously. This calls for cross-functional collaboration across all parts of the organisation\u2013rather than a traditional silo approach (i.e. geology, mining, processing, logistics, marketing\/commercial, finance and HR). This requires the application of the Whittle Integrated Strategic Planning philosophy & methodologies, combined with sophisticated optimisation technology. Only Whittle Consulting has this unique combination combining our expertise with the power of our proprietary software Prober E, the most advanced optimisation software available for the mining industry. With over 30 years of development, Prober E is a multi-thread, cloud-enabled, nonlinear, multi variable, simultaneous optimiser with the power to resolve the largest & most complex Enterprise Optimisation mining models.",

This initial training in biomechanics flowed onto work in ergonomics, human factors engineering and other safety related disciplines. This training was of particular importance when considering the large proportion of costs in any organisation that can be traced back to incidents involving a mismatch in human-machine-environment interaction design, which biomechanics attempts to redress.An academic role was followed by a consulting role with a range of experience in heavy industry such as mining, oil and gas, utilities & chemical, transport (aviation, road, rail & maritime).
